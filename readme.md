This project is all about building a movies server which can function all the CRUD operations.
For making CRUD operations possible multiple routings are added using go modules like net/http, github.com/gorilla/mux, etc

fork it 
pull the repo into your local pc
build it (go build)
(go run main.go)
and have fun navigating through the routes:)
